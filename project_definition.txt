Baseball stats, but make it SHINY
1. Project Overview
The SBU Baseball Analytics Dashboard is a high-performance web application built to centralize player performance data. It replaces static CSV files with a persistent database and an interactive UI, allowing coaches to identify trends and players to review their metrics through a secure, branded portal.
Primary Goal: Provide a "Major League" data experience for a college program.
Key Value Prop: Native R-based statistical power combined with a professional-grade, multi-tenant UI.

2. Project Architecture
The app will follow a decoupled, modular architecture to ensure stability and ease of branding updates.
Data Layer: A PostgreSQL database serves as the "Source of Truth." This prevents data loss and allows for year-over-year longitudinal analysis.
Logic Layer (R Modules): The app is split into distinct functional modules (e.g., mod_pitching, mod_hitting, mod_admin). This keeps the codebase clean and allows for targeted debugging.
Branding Layer: A dynamic CSS engine that injects team-specific colors (SBU Purple) based on the logged-in user’s organization ID.

3. Tech Stack Overview
Component
Technology
Purpose
Language
R
Primary engine for statistical computing and data wrangling.
Framework
Shiny (Modular)
Web framework to build the UI and server logic.
Database
PostgreSQL
Persistent storage for pitch-level and player-level data.
UI / Theme
bslib + thematic
Modern Bootstrap 5 styling and auto-themed visualizations.
Security
shinymanager
Handles encrypted logins, session management, and user roles.
Viz Tools
ggplot2 / Plotly
Renders spray charts, heat maps, and interactive trends.



4. Requirements
Functional Requirements
Multi-Role Access: Admins (Coaches) can upload data and manage rosters; Users (Players) can only view their own performance dashboards.
Data Ingestion: A dedicated "Admin Portal" to upload CSV exports from Trackman/Rapsodo directly into the Postgres DB.
Interactive Analytics:
Spray Charts: Visualizing hit locations on a scaled baseball field.
Pitch Heat Maps: Density plots of pitch locations in the strike zone.
Trend Analysis: Tracking metrics like Exit Velocity or Spin Rate over a season.
Data Persistence: All uploaded data must remain accessible across different sessions and app restarts.
Non-Functional Requirements
Dynamic Branding: The UI must support "white-labeling," allowing the app to switch from SBU branding to a generic or rival team’s branding via database configuration.
Responsiveness: The dashboard must be usable on tablets and mobile devices for dugout access.

5. Sample Timeline & Order of Development
Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Initialize the R project using a modular structure (or the golem framework).
Set up the PostgreSQL database and define the schema for teams, users, and pitch_data.
Establish the database connection pool in global.R.
Phase 2: Security & Branding (Weeks 3-4)
Implement shinymanager for the login interface.
Build the "White-Label" logic: create a function that fetches colors from the DB and applies them via bslib::bs_theme_update().
Finalize SBU-specific CSS and assets (Bearcat logos).
Phase 3: Data Engine (Weeks 5-6)
Develop the Admin Upload Module: Write R scripts to clean raw CSV data and use DBI::dbWriteTable to append it to Postgres.
Build data filtering logic (filtering by Player, Date Range, or Pitch Type).
Phase 4: Visualization Module (Weeks 7-9)
Build the Pitching Module: Heat maps and velocity trends.
Build the Hitting Module: Spray charts and launch angle distributions.
Implement thematic to ensure charts automatically match the SBU theme.
Phase 5: Deployment & UAT (Week 10+)
Deploy the app (e.g., via ShinyApps.io, Posit Connect, or a private VPS using Docker).
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with SBU coaching staff.
